# AI Coding Rules & Architectural Boundaries

You are an expert full-stack developer building `brwne`, an Agentic E2E testing platform. You must adhere strictly to the following architectural constraints. Do not deviate from these rules under any circumstances.

# Deterministic Coder

## STRICT DOCUMENTATION ADHERENCE
When reading and applying documentation (whether provided in the prompt or searched online), you must act as a STRICT parser. Do not "freestyle," optimize, or reformat documented boilerplate.

1. EXACT ORDERING: You must preserve the literal top-to-bottom order of imports, object keys, and configuration properties exactly as they appear in the docs. Do not alphabetize or rearrange them. 
2. EXACT NAMING & PATHS: You must use the literal names for directories, files, variables, and properties provided in the documentation. Do NOT substitute words with synonyms.
3. NO UNPROMPTED ABSTRACTIONS: Treat documentation snippets as rigid templates. Copy the structure 1:1 unless my specific project constraints explicitly force a change.

## CODE COMMENTS
No Procedural Commenting: Never use numbered steps, phases, or hierarchical labels (e.g., // 1., // Step 1.1, // Phase 3).

## CODE PROVENANCE & ANNOTATION
You must annotate the origin of all incorporated code using single-line comments, in addition to any existing comments. Use descriptive labels and maintain contextual placement (inline vs. block). Do not cite local repository files, local project docs, section numbers, or workspace-only paths as provenance sources.

1. GENERATED VIA COMMAND: Add a comment with the exact command.
   ```typescript
   // npx @better-auth/cli generate --output src/db/schema.ts
   export const user = pgTable("user", { /* ... */ });
   ```

2. COPIED FROM DOCUMENTATION: Use specific labels (e.g., "Integration Guide:", "API Reference:") and place URLs contextually. If a URL refers to a specific property, use an inline comment.
   ```typescript
   // Fastify Integration: https://better-auth.com/docs/integrations/fastify
   const fastify = Fastify({ 
     logger: true,
     trustProxy: true // Reference: https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Reference/Server/#trustproxy
   });
   ```

NOTE: if you know that the code was from documentation but you do not know the exact URL, then leave a note: eg `// TODO: add url for <name of the feature>` eg `// TODO: add url for fastify trust proxy`

### Normal Comments & Docstrings
For code comments and docstrings:
- keep them concise
- use lowercase where natural
- avoid filler

Prefer:
```js
// helper func to get playwright toolsets for dynamic usage & validation
// save records from linked list to db
````

Avoid:

```js
// Helper function to get the playwright toolsets for dynamic usage and validation
// Saves all records from the linked list to the database file
```

## JUST-IN-TIME SKILLS & MCP USAGE
Actively discover and invoke specialized capabilities when solving tasks. Do not simulate these tools; invoke them directly. To prevent context poisoning, DO NOT load tools upfront. Discover and invoke skills/MCPs *only* at the exact step their capabilities are required.

1. DISCOVERY:
   - Local skills: Run `skills ls`
   - Global skills: Run `skills ls -g`
   - Available MCPs: Read `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc`

2. ACTIVATION (Syntax must be exact):
   - To use a skill, output: `use <name>` skill (e.g., `use docker-expert` skill)
   - To use an MCP, output: `use <name>` MCP (e.g., `use playwright` MCP)
